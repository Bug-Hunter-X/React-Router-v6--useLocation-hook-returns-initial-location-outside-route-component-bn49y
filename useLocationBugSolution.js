To solve this, the `useLocation` hook needs to be used within a component that is a direct child of a route. If access to the location is needed outside of a route component, you should pass it as a prop from a child of a route.  This approach ensures the hook fetches the correct location context.

```javascript
// useLocationBugSolution.js
import { useLocation } from 'react-router-dom';

function MyComponent() {
  const location = useLocation();
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Current Location:</h1>
      <p>{location.pathname}</p> 
      {/* Access other location properties as needed */}
    </div>
  );
}

export default MyComponent;

//Parent Component to pass down location
function ParentComponent(){
  return(
    <MyComponent/>
  )
}

```
